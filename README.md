#Sketchy
##Graham Davis - Music 256a Final Project

####Current Implementation
Sketchy is a visual composition tool for users of all ages.
In its current implementation, this program allows users to sketch using a variety of
colors and pixel sizes. Pixels are produced by clicking within the drawing canvas.
Each color corresponds to a different audio file, which is granulated as pixels are
being drawn. The x coordinate of the drawn pixel corresponds to the start location 
of the grains. The size of the pixel corresponds to the grain size. Pixels are erased
by clicking the delete key.

####Future Additions
As Sketchy is developed further, users will have more control over grains through
other visual parameters of the sketch pad (y coordinate of pixels, opacity, speed of scrubbing, etc).
Users will also be able to play back their creations and add "stickers" to the sketch pad that influence
global audio parameters (filtering, distortion).
